# AGENTS.md

Instructions for autonomous coding agents working in this repository.

## Scope

- Applies to all agent-driven work in this repo.
- If multiple instruction files exist, follow the most specific one for the
  files you are editing.

## Required Git Rules

1. Commit every turn.
1. Do not amend commits.
1. Do not change branches without explicit user permission.

## Commit Expectations

- Keep commits focused and related to the requested task.
- Use clear commit messages.
- Do not push, pull, or rebase unless explicitly requested.

## Validation

- Run relevant tests before committing when practical.
- If tests cannot be run, state that clearly in the handoff.

## Test Style

- Go tests use `github.com/stretchr/testify` for assertions. Use `require.X`
  when a failed check should abort the test (setup, nil receivers, length checks
  before indexing) and `assert.X` for independent checks that should keep
  running. Don't write `if got != want { t.Fatalf(...) }` in new tests.
- Domain-specific helpers are fine, but they must use testify internally rather
  than stdlib comparisons.

## Safety

- Do not revert user-authored or unrelated local changes unless explicitly
  requested.
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.

## Data Safety

The SQLite database is a persistent archive. Never delete or recreate it to
handle data version changes. Schema changes use ALTER TABLE; parser changes
trigger a full resync (build fresh DB, sync files, copy orphaned sessions from
old DB, atomic swap). Existing session data must be preserved even when source
files no longer exist on disk.

## Build Requirements

- Always run `go build ./...` before committing.
- If the build fails, fix it before committing. Never commit broken code.
- After frontend changes run `cd frontend && npm run build` to verify.

## Commit Convention

Use conventional commits:
- `feat:` new features
- `fix:` bug fixes
- `refactor:` code cleanup
- `chore:` config/build/dependency changes

Examples:
- `feat: add scheduler telegram auto-connect via PI_TELEGRAM_LABEL`
- `fix: scheduler subprocess pi path lookup`
- `chore: update go.mod with robfig/cron dependency`
